# Cursor Rules for Resonances Project

## Code Quality and Testing

- Always run black, flake8, and tests at the end of any code changes to ensure:
  - Code formatting is consistent (black)
  - Code quality standards are met (flake8)
  - All functionality works correctly (pytest)
- Run these commands in sequence:
  ```bash
  poetry run black . --check
  poetry run flake8 --count
  poetry run pytest tests/ -v
  ```

## Project Structure

- For business logic components, use the pattern: lib/{component}, where {component} is the relevant component (e.g., chat, auth, etc.)
- Follow the established directory structure under resonances/

## Testing

- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- All tests must pass before considering work complete
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Code Style

- Use black for code formatting
- Follow flake8 linting rules
- Maintain type hints where appropriate
