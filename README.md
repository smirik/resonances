`resonances` is an open-source package dedicated to the identification of mean-motion resonances of small bodies. Many examples are for the Solar system; however, you might use the package for any possible planetary system, including exoplanets.

For more information, [read the documentation](https://smirik.github.io/resonances/).

**Note:** while this app has many functional and integration tests built in, it is still in the dev stage. Hence, it might include some inconsistencies. So, any community help is appreciated!

## Features

The package:

- can automatically identify two-body and three-body mean-motion resonance in the Solar system,
- accurately differentiates different types of resonances (pure, transient, uncertain),
- provides an interface for mass tasks (i.e. find resonant areas in a planetary system),
- can plot time series and periodograms,
- and, yeah, it is well tested ;)

It actively uses [REBOUND integrator](https://rebound.readthedocs.io) maintained by Hanno Rein and others.

## Installation

To install resonances on your system, follow the instructions on the appropriate [installation guide](https://smirik.github.io/resonances/install/)
